Overview
This project simulates the role of a Security Analyst investigating a network issue faced by a travel agency. The website became unresponsive due to a SYN Flood attack — a form of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack targeting the web server with an overwhelming number of SYN requests.

Scenario Summary
An automated monitoring alert reported a timeout issue on the company’s sales website. Using packet sniffing tools, I discovered a large volume of unauthorized TCP SYN requests from an unknown IP address, causing the server to crash due to resource exhaustion.


Key Actions Taken
Identified SYN Flood as the root cause.
Captured and analyzed TCP/IP traffic logs.
Temporarily took the server offline for recovery.
Configured the firewall to block the attacker’s IP.
Drafted a cybersecurity incident report for management
